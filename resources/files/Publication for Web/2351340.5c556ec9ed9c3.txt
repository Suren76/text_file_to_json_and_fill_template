A simplified material was created for exporting to the FBX file, since Because of the composite materials, errors may have occurred when importing into a new scene. Therefore, when opening FBX in a new scene, we immediately add the full material. The full material file and all textures naturally lie next to the model in the archive. If necessary, you may have to correct the paths to the textures through Asset Tracking.
