3dsMax files (.max) are saved in version 2015, so it is recommended to open them in versions 3dsMax 2015 above
Corona Renderer (1.7) and Vray (3.60.03) were used for rendering

For Corona render, it is recommended to install a version of at least 1.5, since the glossiness of materials is configured taking into account PBR

Who works in the V-Ray version lower than 3.1, be careful, in the materials in the BRDF section is Microfaset GTR (GGX),
if your version is older than 3.1, then the BRDF field will be empty. Choose Blinn, Phong or Ward - which is preferable for you.
