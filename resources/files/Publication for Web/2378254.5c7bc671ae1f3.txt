======================================
The kitchen is assembled as carefully as possible, if desired, you can easily change it for your project.

All textures and models in high quality are perfect for rendering from a close perspective.
======================================
Units in millimeters.
No third-party plugin or script required.
======================================
Who works in the V-Ray version is lower than 3.1. Be careful, in the materials in the BRDF section there is a Microfaset GTR (GGX), if your version is older than 3.1, then the BRDF field will be empty. Choose Blinn, Phong or Ward - which is preferable to you.

For Corona render, it is recommended to install a version not lower than 1.5, since the glossiness of materials is customized taking into account PBR

Enjoy using and beautiful renders!
