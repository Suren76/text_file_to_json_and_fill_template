Good evening! I'd be happy to see my little bears in your child, in a luxurious bedroom, a cozy recreation room, a color game, on a shelf, on the bed, on the mantelpiece, on a window sill or even on the floor :) ---------- ---------------------- Bears grown from a single site. All items, such as eyes, ears, nose, belly and inner parts of the clutches have different ID, respectively - different materials, while remaining one. Bears and other parts of the compositions have a scan, so no fur will look good
