Not only to give the room additional depth, light and a feel of an extra dimension, the GUBI Mirror also unifies the interior setting. With its substantial size, the GUBI Mirror becomes a fundamental element to the decoration and comes to its right when it is allowed to dominate the wall. At the same time, the rounded shape, with an elegant brass edge, softens and give warmth to the atmosphere.

The FA 33 Mirror was originally designed by the legendary designer Gio Ponti in 1933 for that period's most prominent lamp, glass and mirror manufacturer FontanaArte, which Ponti and Pietro Chiesa founded a couple of years earlier.

Dimensions: 54 x 80, 69 x 146, 110 (cm)
