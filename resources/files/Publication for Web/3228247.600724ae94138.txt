Accent lighting solutions in apartments, restaurants and offices should look good on their own. The small dimensions of the minimalist KARI shape complement such spaces very well. Subtle mechanical elements, elegant finishes, balanced shape - these few features make KARI an accent luminaire that is an elegant addition in itself.

The model includes 13 configurations of LED luminaires and also the necessary blocks for developing your own scheme of an overhead or suspended track.

Models are available in 11 colors (white, black, gold, copper, silver and combinations).

The model is configured with pivots and dependent snaps to easily adjust the angle of rotation and movement of the lamp.

The archive includes a version of the model with the lights off.
