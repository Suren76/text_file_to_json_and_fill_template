Polys: 94 777 Quads only. OBJ without smoothing. Turbosmooth is applied to most objects during rendering. All objects and materials are logically named. The \"heaviest\" object in the scene is a brush. Who works in a V-Ray version lower than 3.1 be careful, there is a Microfaset GTR ( GGX) in the materials in the BRDF section, if your version is older than 3.1, then the BRDF field will be empty. Choose Blinn, Phong or Ward â€“ which is preferable for you. For Corona render, it is recommended to install a version not lower than 1.5, since the glossiness of materials is configured with PBR in mind.
